\usage{
eval_calidad(
  mydata,
  type_est = "prop",
  est_var = "p_tdnr_admnhog",
  group_var = "cui_psdf_o_resp_nna",
  subpop = "TRUE",
  qst = "cut",
  id_estimacion = "prop_cuid_p_tdnr_admnhog"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{A data frame or tibble containing the survey data.}

\item{type_est}{A string specifying the type of estimation to be evaluated:
proportions (\code{"prop"}), means (\code{"mean"}) or totals (\code{"total"}).
Default is \code{"prop"}.}

\item{est_var}{Estimation variable. Its interpretation depends on the selected
estimation type (e.g. binary or categorical for proportions, numeric for
means and totals).}

\item{group_var}{Grouping variable used to produce disaggregated estimations.
Must be categorical. If no grouping is required, set to \code{"NULL"} (as a string).}

\item{subpop}{Subpopulation definition used for the estimation, provided as a
character string. If no subpopulation is required, use \code{"TRUE"}.}

\item{qst}{Questionnaire identifier to which the estimation variable belongs.
Possible values are \code{"ch"} or \code{"cut"}.}

\item{id_estimacion}{A character string used to label and identify the estimation
in the output. This parameter does not affect the computation itself.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing estimation results and quality indicators, including a
classification of reliability.
}
\description{
This function provides a unified interface to evaluate the quality of different
types of survey estimations. Depending on the selected estimation type, the function
assesses the reliability of proportions, means, or totals and returns a standardized
output with quality indicators.
}
\details{
\code{eval_calidad()} is a wrapper around the quality evaluation tools implemented in the
\pkg{calidad} package, allowing users to assess estimation quality through a single
function call, regardless of the type of estimate.

Estimations are classified according to their reliability (e.g. reliable, weakly
reliable, non-reliable), based on predefined quality criteria.


This function simplifies the workflow for estimation quality assessment by:
\itemize{
  \item providing a single entry point for proportions, means, and totals;
  \item enforcing a consistent input structure across estimation types;
  \item returning a standardized output format for downstream analysis or reporting.
}
}
