\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing the data to be evaluated. Rows should correspond
to individuals, columns to questions, and an \code{interview__key} column should be
present to identify each unit.}

\item{eval_suf_1}{Logical. \code{TRUE} to run Sufficiency 1 evaluation.}

\item{eval_suf_2}{Logical. \code{TRUE} to run Sufficiency 2 evaluation.}

\item{eval_suf_3}{Logical. \code{TRUE} to run Sufficiency 3 evaluation.}

\item{mod_suf_cut}{Character vector identifying the modules that contain time
use questions. If the dataset is not split by modules, simply provide the prefix
of the time use questions.}

\item{mod_esen_cut}{Optional. For Sufficiency 1 evaluation. In addition to evaluating
all time use modules, a subset of modules can be defined as "essential", with their
own completeness threshold for sufficiency.}

\item{id_edit}{Value used to identify responses considered invalid in the dataset.
Default is -777.}

\item{prop_suf}{Numeric. Proportion of valid responses required for the time use
modules to be considered sufficient.}

\item{prop_esen}{Numeric. Proportion of valid responses required for modules
identified as "essential".}

\item{detalle_mod_esen}{(pending)}

\item{umbral_act_cut}{Integer. Minimum number of time use activities required
for sufficiency.}

\item{umbral_min_t}{Numeric. Lower limit of the acceptable range for total hours.}

\item{umbral_max_t}{Numeric. Upper limit of the acceptable range for total hours.}

\item{detail}{Logical. \code{FALSE} to return only the three insufficiency columns.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing binary variables indicating insufficient information
in time use modules, based on different criteria.
}
\description{
This function creates a data frame with binary columns indicating whether the
surveyed unit meets certain criteria for sufficient time use information.
}
\details{
The criteria are as follows:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Sufficiency 1}: the time use modules for the surveyed unit meet arequired percentage of valid information.
  \item \strong{Sufficiency 2}: the time use modules for the surveyed unit contain valid time data for a minimum number of activities.
  \item \strong{Sufficiency 3}: the total number of hours reported by the surveyed unit falls within a predefined acceptable range.
}

Each insufficiency criterion has an associated binary column, and optionally,
complementary columns can be included for more detailed review.
\itemize{
  \item \code{insuf_cut_1}: indicates that the percentage of valid responses in the time use modules is greater than the defined threshold. If "essential" modules are specified, their valid response percentage will also be considered for sufficiency.
  \item \code{insuf_cut_2}: indicates that the interview does not meet the minimum number of activities with valid time use data.
  \item \code{insuf_cut_3}: indicates that the total number of hours reported in the interview is lower or higher, respectively, than the established minimum and maximum limits.
}

The function assumes that the data is organized by different time use modules,
each providing the prefix to their respective questions. For example, if there
is an unpaid work time use module identified by \code{"td"}, variable names within that
module should start with the prefix \code{"td"} (for example, \code{td_1}).
