\title{Count the number of triggered validations}
\usage{
val_monitor(data, vars, mod, qst_valprimer, id_regla, tipo_val, qst_valseg)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A wide-format data frame where each column represents a validation,
either first-level (variable x type of error) or second-level (validation rule).
This is the output of the \code{valprimer()} function.}

\item{vars}{A character vector with the names of the validated variables.}

\item{mod}{A character vector indicating the module to which each variable belongs.}

\item{qst_valprimer}{A character vector indicating the questionnaire to which
each variable belongs (for first-level validations).}

\item{id_regla}{A character vector with the unique identifiers of the validation rules.}

\item{tipo_val}{A character vector indicating the type of validation rule.
Possible values: \code{"adv"} (warning) or \code{"inc"} (inconsistency).}

\item{qst_valseg}{A character vector indicating the questionnaire to which each
validation rule belongs (for second-level validations).}
}
\value{
A list with three data frames showing the number of triggered validations
at different levels of analysis: variable, module, and questionnaire.
}
\description{
This function returns a list of three data frames in long format. Each
data frame reports the number of triggered validations at different levels
of analysis: by variable, by module, and by questionnaire.
}
\details{
A triggered validation can be understood in two ways:
\itemize{
  \item For first-level validations, it refers to the number of rows with errors (error1, error2, or error3). For details, see the documentation of the \code{valprimer()} function.
  \item For second-level validations, it refers to the number of rows that violate a validation rule.
}

The function assumes two inputs:
\itemize{
  \item A metadata table that indicates the variables in the questionnaire, the modules they belong to, and the corresponding questionnaire.
  \item A metadata table that defines the validation rules in the questionnaire, the type of validation (e.g., warning or inconsistency), and the corresponding questionnaire.
}
}
